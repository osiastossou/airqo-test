# airqo-test

Air is one of the elements that allow man to survive. Thus, it is important that its quality be monitored to avoid diseases.
This report presents the data modeling work to predict air quality over time.
We received a dataset of about 2 GB. This dataset contains property records measuring air quality at 42 sites in 3 years (2019 - 2020 - 2021). 
In the paper we will present an analysis of the data and modeling for the prediction of air quality property values each hour of the day.
